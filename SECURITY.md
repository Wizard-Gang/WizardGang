# Security policy

## Supported surface

Security reports are accepted for the current `wizardgang.ai` site and its stateless TypeScript compatibility Worker.

SharkTank, Hexframe, YarReader, and the detailed Demo Framework application are separate system boundaries. Report product-specific issues through the owning repository or operating surface.

## Report privately

Email `jacob@wizardgang.ai` with the affected URL, impact, and minimal safe reproduction steps.

Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability. Do not include passwords, credentials, private records, destructive proof, or data belonging to another person.

## Site boundary

WizardGang.ai serves generated static HTML, CSS, a first-party browser module, public media, and `version.json` through Cloudflare. It does not accept visitor accounts, passwords, payments, uploads, or form submissions.

`public/_headers` is the production HTTP-header authority. It includes the production Content Security Policy and HTTPS-only controls. Local HTTP development never edits that source file; the dev lifecycle sanitizes only the generated `dist/_headers` copy by removing HSTS and `upgrade-insecure-requests`.

The browser architecture does not require inline application scripts or React hydration. First-party browser behavior is emitted as a Vite module from `src/browser/`.

Automated checks, source review, dry-run/staging validation, versioned source, and rollback options reduce risk but do not guarantee that defects or incidents cannot occur.
