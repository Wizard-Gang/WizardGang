# Active implementation plan

**Portfolio plan maintenance notice.** The owner may direct an additive update to this active queue while another task or pull request is in progress. Keep every existing open task and its order; a plan amendment neither implements nor retires it. After the shared policy setup, a routine amendment changes only this plan file. Before merging, re-fetch authoritative `main` and open pull requests, compare the current plan and exact head with the recorded base, and rebase/reconcile if either moved. Require current exact-head checks and mergeability so concurrent work is not overwritten. Any earlier “final task” or “no queue remains” wording applies to its original wave; it keeps this plan while appended tasks remain, and only the actual last task deletes it.

This is WizardGang.ai's current/future process-convergence wave under WG-ARCH-001 §27.

The current company-site architecture, React/TypeScript presentation, route ownership, accessibility contracts, Cloudflare Worker boundary, and local-development lifecycle are already established. This wave does not reopen the landed frontend or information-architecture work. Its purpose is to bring repository governance, npm/toolchain use, controlled changes, CI, merge behavior, tagging, GitHub Releases, and Cloudflare production deployment onto the shared WizardGang delivery model.

Existing history remains immutable and is not retroactively rewritten. Completed tasks are retained only in Git/GitHub history.

The target delivery path is:

```text
branch
→ npm ci
→ npm run check
→ pull request
→ exact-head CI
→ squash merge
→ verify main
→ explicit version-bump release change
→ annotated immutable tag
→ reproduce tagged source
→ GitHub Release
→ deploy exact released tag
→ verify deployed release + commit
```

A release is initiated through an ordinary controlled version-bump PR rather than an untracked manual production command. This keeps tagging, publication, and deployment reachable through the same reviewed GitHub path used for every other change.

Production remains Cloudflare-only. No normalization task introduces another hosting or deployment provider.

## Shared portfolio baseline to implement and prove

This queue covers the eight active application/demo repositories: Hexframe, SharkTank, WizardGang, YarReader, FightLab, Boneyard, SVGLab, and wizardgang-architecture-demo. The separate baseline seed repository is downstream of this convergence; House, RealEstate, Warcraft, archived/generated/dependency-only repositories, and unrelated feature work are outside this wave. Re-fetch every target before implementation; these planning observations are not proof of future provider state.

- **Controlled delivery:** Keep one permanent repository ID per change. Branch from exact current `main`; run local validation; open a PR; require every repository-specific check on its exact current head; squash that head once into protected/current `main`; confirm one controlled commit, post-merge CI, and automatic branch deletion. Preserve each current required check name and strict current-with-main behavior. Repository and main-ruleset merge methods are squash only; merge/rebase commits, ordinary direct pushes, force pushes, deletion, and bypass actors remain disabled. Immutable `refs/tags/v*` rules and existing release/deployment gates remain in force.
- **GitHub administration:** `npm run check` is credential-free. `npm run verify:github-settings` reads live settings without mutation. Only `npm run apply:github-settings` normally mutates settings represented by committed authority, then independently re-reads and verifies them. Use `GH_ADMIN_TOKEN`, with `GH_TOKEN` only if it has the required permission. Keep credentials solely in process/provider secret state; fail closed with useful read-versus-admin/write errors; never print or persist token values; never allow environment variables to redirect the committed repository identity. Preserve repository-specific pure cases for merge policy, strict checks, zero bypass, tag immutability, and branch auto-delete. Current live settings already meet the merge/ruleset target, so do not reapply them solely for this wave.
- **Common npm/toolchain cohort:** Target Node `26.10.0` and npm `12.1.0` in `.node-version`, `packageManager`, engines, CI and the regenerated lockfile. For packages actually used by more than one repository, target the compatible shared versions established by the current portfolio comparison: Vite `8.3.1`, Vitest `5.0.2`, TypeScript `7.0.2`, React/React DOM `19.3.0`, Wrangler `4.141.0`, and `@types/node` `26.6.3`. Do not add an unused package. A tested technical incompatibility must be recorded as a specific exception, including its owner and follow-up; do not silently drift. Keep `npm ci` reproducible and review npm install-script allowlisting with `strict-allow-scripts=true` wherever npm 12 runs lifecycle scripts.
- **Commands and CI:** Preserve the existing canonical `npm run check` and focused settings tests. Keep live dependency advisories separate as `npm run audit:dependencies` (a compatibility alias may retain an existing command); never require a registry or GitHub credential for `check`. Keep each repository's required CI names. Required PR jobs explicitly check out `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` with full history where controlled-history checks need it; merged-`main` jobs check the accepted commit. Pin shared official GitHub Actions to reviewed full commit SHAs, with least-needed workflow permissions. Preserve product-specific integration, build, accessibility, release and deployment checks.
- **Public source and release boundaries:** Preserve the current byte-identical `CONTRIBUTING.md` contract, root guidance, source license and security policy. Add or retain a bounded credential-free scan of tracked files and reachable public Git history for secrets, with pure positive/negative cases and no rewriting of published commits. Do not create a tag, Release, production deploy, version bump, secret, DNS change, or Cloudflare mutation for baseline normalization. When a product later releases, preserve its reviewed-main -> immutable annotated tag -> reproducible tag build -> GitHub Release -> protected exact-tag deployment -> public identity verification path; local-only/library repositories keep their explicit no-production boundary.

For each task, validate with the pinned toolchain, `npm ci`, focused cases, `npm run check`, `git diff --check`, applicable separate advisory/provider checks, exact-head CI, and a fresh post-merge/provider audit. Existing successful controls should be verified and retained, not rebuilt for cosmetic uniformity.

## Open tasks

### WG-098 — [OPS] Converge common agent instructions and permanent empty plan queue

- Dependency: WG-096 delivered; preserve every existing queued task and its order. The baseline seed remains downstream of this repository convergence.
- Scope: Install the byte-identical portfolio `AGENTS.md` governing fresh authority discovery, first-open-task selection, controlled identity, credential-free validation, exact-head PR CI, squash merge, post-merge verification, and empty-queue planning mode. Move this repository's unique product, source-consumer, required-check, release and deployment guidance into `README.md` or its linked current authorities without weakening it. Standardize the queue filename to lowercase `implementation_plan.md`, updating links, scripts, history/documentation validators and tests. Retire this task into the same permanent, byte-identical empty queue used by all eight repositories and the baseline seed; its instructions must say that the next instruction fills the queue through a controlled plan-only change before implementation starts. Keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` byte-identical across the portfolio as its final-plan deletion rule is replaced.
- Acceptance: No open task heading remains after delivery; the empty plan file stays tracked and a credential-free test proves that an empty queue selects no implementation task and requires a new controlled planning change. The published `AGENTS.md` and empty-plan bytes match the canonical portfolio copies. Repository-specific required checks, GitHub settings, source pins, release/deployment boundaries, and any documented compatibility exception remain authoritative. No release or production deployment occurs for this convergence.
- Validation: Re-fetch current `main` and the canonical portfolio files; run focused queue/history/documentation/settings cases, the pinned `npm ci`, `npm run check`, separate `npm run audit:dependencies` where applicable, `npm run verify:github-settings`, committed-range and whitespace checks, exact-head required CI, squash merge, post-merge CI and branch deletion. Finish with a fresh eight-repository byte-hash and provider audit before establishing the baseline repository.

## Invariants for the whole wave

- Preserve the current seven-route company-site architecture and current product boundaries.
- Preserve the safe checkout-owned `npm run dev` lifecycle.
- `npm run check` remains the single canonical credential-free repository acceptance gate.
- Provider-aware verification is explicit and never hidden inside local acceptance.
- Human-controlled WG changes land as one squash commit once squash-only enforcement is active.
- Published commits, tags, and Releases are never rewritten.
- Production is Cloudflare-only and is never sourced from an arbitrary checkout.
- A completed task is removed from this file by its delivering change.
- The final task deletes this file; Git, PRs, Actions, tags, Releases, and deployment evidence retain history.

## Recheck after this wave

Re-audit WizardGang.ai and the other active repositories from fresh provider state. Use the resulting WizardGang process as one candidate common reference for normal npm/CI/merge/tag/release/deploy semantics, while preserving explicit N/A boundaries for repositories that do not have a hosted production surface.
