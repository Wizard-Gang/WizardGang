# WizardGang

[WizardGang.ai](https://wizardgang.ai) is the company site for WizardGang. The home page scans in one pass — industries, integrations, projects — and every row opens in place.

```text
/                        selected industries, integrations and projects
/solutions/              capabilities, then the professional record
/projects/               project index
/projects/sharktank/     case study
/projects/hexframe/      case study
/projects/yarreader/     case study
/about/                  the pitch, the person, the career record
```

Navigation is Solutions, Projects, About. Solutions and Projects link to their index pages and open their menus on hover or keyboard focus; contact is in the footer. These seven routes are the whole site: retired paths return the ordinary 404. The generated 404 is noindex and is not a sitemap entry.

The Worker keeps only what was never a page here — `/github`, `/compliance`, `/accessibility` and `/security` point outward — plus the SharkTank product boundary.

## Architecture

WizardGang.ai is a static-first React and TypeScript application:

```text
React + TypeScript page composition
→ typed page registry
→ Vite static build
→ complete HTML + generated CSS/browser module
→ Cloudflare assets + TypeScript Worker
```

React renders complete static documents during the build. There is no client React hydration and no SPA router. Browser TypeScript progressively enhances language, display preferences, and mobile navigation.

The TypeScript Worker owns runtime routing that cannot be expressed as static assets alone, including compatibility redirects and product-boundary routing. Wrangler owns local runtime and Cloudflare deployment configuration.

## Presentation

Two authored stylesheets, one job each:

- `src/styles/tokens.css` — the design system: one palette, one type scale, one spacing scale, and the self-hosted faces. It may declare only `:root` custom properties and `@font-face`, which the acceptance gate enforces.
- `src/styles/globals.css` — every rule, consuming those tokens.

Every heading resolves to one of four scale tokens, so a page cannot invent its own display size. Instrument Sans and JetBrains Mono ship from `public/fonts/` as latin-subset variable WOFF2 under the SIL Open Font License; the production policy is `default-src 'none'` with `font-src 'self'`, so a font from another origin would not load.

## Content ownership

- Home — selected industries and integrations collapse as whole sections; projects are a row each, because each row carries a preview. Everything starts closed, and a preview animates only while its panel is open.
- Solutions — Capabilities first: each working example links to its architecture demo, with a link to the full demo workbench. The professional record follows in three sections, projected from `src/data/professional-systems.ts`, with every deployment carrying what was delivered and the employer it was delivered under.
- Projects — an index of the work, then one case study per project: problem, what was built, architecture, approach, result.
- About — the argument for the practice, the person, and the career record.

Typed domain data lives under `src/data/`. Industries, integrations and deployments are Jacob Yongue's employment record, not WizardGang client work, and Solutions states that boundary before the professional record.

## Run locally

Install the locked dependencies and start the normal local environment:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` is checkout-scoped. It:

1. stops stale Wrangler/Vite processes only when their saved process metadata proves they belong to this checkout;
2. resets generated `dist/`, `tmp/dev/`, and `tmp/frontend-shell/` state;
3. runs the production static build;
4. sanitizes only the generated local `dist/_headers` copy for plain HTTP;
5. starts Vite build watch;
6. starts `wrangler dev --local` at `http://127.0.0.1:8790`;
7. waits for the Wrangler-served site to respond;
8. opens the local URL and remains attached to both required child processes.

Use another port when needed:

```bash
WIZARDGANG_PORT=9123 npm run dev
```

If a requested port belongs to an unrelated process, startup fails rather than terminating that process. Stop the environment with `Ctrl-C`.

Production security policy remains in `public/_headers`. Local development removes HSTS and `upgrade-insecure-requests` only from the generated `dist/_headers` copy; do not weaken `public/_headers` to make localhost work.

## Build and verify

Build the complete static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build emits the static HTML pages, public assets, generated CSS/browser JavaScript, `sitemap.xml` and `version.json` into `dist/`. The sitemap is a projection of the page registry, never a second route list.

The authoritative repository acceptance gate is:

```bash
npm run check
```

It includes strict TypeScript checking, the production build, frontend-architecture authority, generated-page contracts, accessibility, browser behavior, project and solution ownership, Worker routing, local-development lifecycle, metadata, links, and security/header boundaries.

Useful focused checks include:

```bash
npm run test:accessibility
npm run test:frontend-authority
npm run test:navigation
npm run test:docs
```

Key authorities:

- `src/app/pageRegistry.ts` — generated page inventory.
- `src/app/navigation.ts` — primary navigation and current-section model.
- `src/data/projects.ts` — project facts, routes, tags, actions, and the Projects menu.
- `src/data/capabilities.ts` — what WizardGang can demonstrate, and the demo fragment that proves each one.
- `src/data/solutions-menu.ts` — the Solutions page sections and menu.
- `src/data/professional-systems.ts` — the domains, systems and deployments Solutions projects.

- `src/data/team.ts`, `src/data/professional.ts`, `src/data/professional-systems.ts` — people, career history, and attributed evidence.
- `src/components/ProjectSurfaces.tsx` — shared project presentation contract.
- `src/app/Document.tsx` — static document, metadata, and sitemap composition.
- `src/worker/index.ts` — compatibility and runtime routing.
- `src/styles/tokens.css` — the design system.
- `vite.config.ts` — static build pipeline.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — local/staging/production Cloudflare configuration.

## Deployment

Cloudflare environments are defined in `wrangler.jsonc`. Validate deploy packaging without publishing:

```bash
npm run deploy:staging:dry-run
npm run deploy:production:dry-run
```

Real staging or production deployment is a separate release action and is not part of `npm run check`.
